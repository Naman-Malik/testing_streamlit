## App data

To get the data behind this app, follow these steps:

1. Open a new SQL Worksheet.

2. Copy the contents of the file `data/creation_script.sql` into the Worksheet. Execute the `CREATE` statements of the script, which creates a database and schema.

3. When you create a new Streamlit App, Snowflake automatically generates a new stage for this app. Access this stage in the Data section on the left side of the screen. Navigate to Databases, find the database associated with your Streamlit App (e.g., `SampleDatabase.Stargazers`).

4. Select the database, then choose the schema where you created the Streamlit App (e.g., public).

![Look for database](../shared_assets/look_for_database.png).

5. Navigate to Stages to view the available stages. Snowflake has automatically created a Stage with an autogenerated name.

6. Click on the stage name. The first time, it will prompt you to “Enable Directory Listing”. Click on that button.

7. Choose a warehouse.

8. Click on “+ Files” in the upper right corner to open a popup where you can add the required files.

9. Upload the files by clicking on the "Upload" button in the lower right corner. Note that if a file has the same name as an existing file in the stage, the new file will overwrite the previous one.

10. With these steps, you have successfully uploaded files into your Streamlit App.

11. Access this [shared database](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZTSZAS2KJ3/cybersyn-github-archive) from [Cybersyn](https://www.cybersyn.com/) in order to get the GitHub repo information.
